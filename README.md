# A repository of images for recreating the Mold Gold Cape in 3D

![](mold_gold_cape__iteration_1_.gif)

3D data for recreation of a British Museum object.

A low resolution, first iteration of modeling the famous Mold Gold Cape. This is very rough internally and around the top edges. It will improve as more effective masking is done and some more photos are added. The cape is too fragile to remove from the internal supporting structure.
